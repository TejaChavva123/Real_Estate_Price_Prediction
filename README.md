# Real Estate Price Prediction

Here I have calculated the price of house in a bengaluru with features of number of bhk,total sq_ft,number of bathrooms,availability,location. Here I have used the multiple Linear Regression algorithm to predict the price and r2_score metrics for calculation of performance and all the categorical values are converted to Numerical data by using Label Encoding.

# Procedure
 1) Loading the dataset
 2) Data preprocessing
 3) Exploratory Data Analysis
 4) Converting categorical values to Numerical values
 5) Model building
 6) Calculating score or performance

# Algorithm used
  Multiple Linear Regression
  
# Python libraries used
 1) Numpy
 2) Pandas
 3) Matplotlib
 4) Seaborn
 5) Scikit-Learn
